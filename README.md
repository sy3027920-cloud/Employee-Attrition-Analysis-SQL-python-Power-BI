**Employee Attrition Dashboard – Data Analytics using SQL, Python, and Power BI**

# Employee Attrition Analysis

##  Brief Summary

A data analytics project to analyze employee attrition trends and provide actionable insights using visualization dashboards.

---

## 🔎 Overview

Employee attrition is one of the major challenges for HR departments. This project focuses on analyzing attrition patterns across departments, salary bands, job roles, performance ratings, and demographics to identify key drivers of employee turnover.

---

##  Problem Statement

High attrition rates increase hiring costs and reduce organizational productivity. The problem is to **identify major factors contributing to employee attrition** and suggest preventive strategies based on data-driven insights.

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source**: kaggle
* **Rows**: ~1,470 employees
* **Features**: Demographics, Education, Job Role, Salary, Performance Rating, Attrition Flag, etc.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **SQL** – Data cleaning, querying, and aggregations
* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visualizations

---

##  Methods

1. **Data Collection** – Gather Employee dataset from Kaggle
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle nulls, duplicates, and inconsistent values
3. **SQL Analysis** – Used aggregations, filtering, and CASE statements to uncover employee patterns. Extracted insights on attrition rate by department, job role, performance, and salary band.
4. **Python EDA** – Cleaned HR dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types.
Engineered new features such as Age Group, Income Band, and Attrition Flags for deeper insights.
5. **Power BI Dashboard** – Build interactive visuals (filters, slicers, KPIs, bar/column charts, pie charts)
6. **Insight Generation** – Identify top attrition factors

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Overall attrition rate: **17.1%**
* **Mid-age employees** show the highest attrition count
* **Sales Executives** and **Research Scientists** have the highest attrition by job role
* Attrition is higher among employees with **Low Salary Band**
* **Overtime workers** contribute significantly to attrition
